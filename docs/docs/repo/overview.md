# Overview

[Nx](https://nx.dev/) is a set of extensible dev tools for monorepos and allows
for [third-party plugins](https://nx.dev/nx-community) to add support for other
technologies. [nx-bun](https://github.com/jordan-hall/nx-bun) is a collection of plugins designed to use the power of Bun for an Nx workspace.
